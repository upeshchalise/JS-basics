    <h1>This is challenge 6</h1>

    <!-- Notice in challenge 5, if a user types
    something other than a number, the console
    tells us they entered a big number. In this
    challenge, fix that so that if a user types
    something other than a number, the console
    displays a message that says there was an
    error. -->
