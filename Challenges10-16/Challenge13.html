    <h1>This is the Challenge 13</h1>

    <!-- For this challenge handle the situation that
    happens if the user clicks cancel on the
    prompt, or does not enter text in the prompt.

    If the user does one of those two actions,
    have the hello() function log to the console
    "You didn't give me your name". Otherwise,
    have the console log the greeting.     -->



    <script>

        const yourName = prompt('What is your name?');

        
        function hello(name) {
            
            if(name == "" || name == null) {
            console.log(`You didn't give me a name`);
        }

            else {
                console.log(`Hello ${name}, and Welcome!!`);
