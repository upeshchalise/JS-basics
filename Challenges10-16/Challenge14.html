    <h1>This is the Challenge 14</h1>

    <!-- For this challenge, update the hello() function
    so that it returns a value rather than outputs
    directly to the console.

    I used a variable: var greeting; and returned
    that variable at the end of the function.

    Then outside the function write a call to the
    console that logs the greeting returned by the
    function.Challenge 14 Answer -->





<script>

const yourName = prompt('what is your name?');

function hello(name) {
    var greetings;

    if(name == null || name == "") {
        greetings = `You didn't give me a name`;
    }
    else {
        greetings = `Hello ${name}, and welcome!!`;
    }
    
    return greetings;
}

console.log(hello(yourName));
