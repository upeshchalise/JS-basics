    <h1>This is the challenge 15</h1>

    <!-- For this challenge, add an array of foods and
    put 3-5 elements in the array. Then make a
    new function called hospitality(); after the
    hello(); function.
    
    The new function will take two parameters, a
    name and a gift, which will be an array. Have
    this function run the hello() function and
    output the result to the console. Then have it
    loop through the gift array and offer a gift to
    the visitor by name and output that to the
    console. -->
